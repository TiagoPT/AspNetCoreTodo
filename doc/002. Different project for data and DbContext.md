# Different project for data and DbContext

In a project we should have a separation of concerns, therefore the data definition should exist in a different project from the presentation layer. In this case, AspNetCoreTodo.Web is holds the website and the AspNetCoreTodo.Data contains the database entities and migrations.

## Changes in service configuration

To account for this change, the service configuration in Startup.cs needs to be updated accordingly to specify where the migration files are located. It's better to use reflection and dinamically get the assembly name, instead of using a string that won't trigger an error upon renaming the migrations assembly project.

```
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlite(
            Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"), 
            optionsBuilder => optionsBuilder.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(ApplicationDbContext).Assembly.FullName)
        ));
```

## Adding a migration

With this separation, the ``dotnet ef`` commands should be executed in the Data project folder, but the startup project is still Web. Therefore the command to add a migration needs an extra parameter:

```
dotnet ef migrations add <migration name> -s ../AspNetCoreTodo.Web
```

The paths on the commands are always relative to the directory where it is being executed.
