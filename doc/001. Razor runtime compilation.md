# Razor Runtime compilation

Starting on .NET Core 3, runtime compilation of Razor views is no longer enabled. This is done to remove the dependency on Roslyn compiler (see [Issue 7647](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/7647)).

It is possible to have it enabled, but NuGet package[ Microsoft.AspNetCore Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation/) and in Startup.cs add the following code:

```
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages()
        .AddRazorRuntimeCompilation();

    // code omitted for brevity
}
```
